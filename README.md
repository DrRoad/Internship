*2: Shiny Dashboard for Visualization*

The aim of the project is to provide optimal indoor conditions to the occupants contributing towards comfortability impacting their productivity, by taking into account various comfort factors together with moving towards smart building to save energy by identifying occupancy pattern.
An effective measurement of all these parameters requires real time and continuous data collection covering the entire area with minimum information loss and reduced cost w.r.t. number of sensors deployed enabling the facility operator to operate the building efficiently across all the performance metrics.
